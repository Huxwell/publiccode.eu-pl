00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Imagine for a moment

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.900
our government would treat our public infrastructure,

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.100
like our streets and public buildings,

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.480
the same way it treats our digital infrastructure:

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.560
Our members of parliament would work in a rented space

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.360
where they weren't allowed to vote in favor of stricter environmental laws

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.240
because the owner - a multinational corporation -

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.580
didn't allow that kind of voting in its buildings.

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.240
Nor will it allow a long overdue upgrade

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.240
to more than 500 seats.

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.820
This means some members of parliament have to stay outside, in the street.

12
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.940
And a couple of blocks away

13
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.960
a brand new gym is already being torn down,

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.460
just six months after it was built.

15
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.440
It's being replaced with an exact replica -

16
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.020
at great expense.

17
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.440
And the only difference:

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.460
The new manufacturer also provides "Streetball" as an added feature.

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.620
Meanwhile,

20
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
every night, through a hidden backdoor in the city hall,

21
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.920
documents that contain sensitive information on citizens,

22
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
from bank data to healthcare records,

23
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
are being stolen.

24
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.060
But no one is allowed to do anything about it,

25
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.760
because searching for backdoors and locking them

26
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840
would infringe the signed user agreement.

27
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.540
And as absurd as this sounds,

28
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.120
when it comes to our digital infrastructure -

29
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.220
things like the software and programs

30
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.560
that our governments are using everyday -

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.660
this comparison is pretty accurate.

32
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.040
Because mostly,

33
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.820
our administrations procure proprietary software.

34
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.420
This means a lot of money goes into licenses

35
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.960
that last for a limited amount of time

36
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.360
and restrict our rights.

37
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.000
We aren't allowed to use our infrastructure

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in a reasonable way.

39
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.580
And because the source code of proprietary software

40
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.320
is usually a business secret,

41
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.640
finding security holes or deliberately installed backdoors

42
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.960
is extremely difficult and even illegal.

43
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.580
But our public administrations can do better!

44
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.540
If all publicly financed software were to be Free and Open Source,

45
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.440
we could use and share our infrastructure

46
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.140
for anything and for as long as we wanted.

47
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140
We could upgrade it,

48
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
repair it,

49
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.580
and remodel it

50
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.360
in any way to fit our needs.

51
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.800
And because the "Open Source" in Free Software means

52
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.080
that the blueprint is openly readable for everyone,

53
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.860
this makes it much easier to find and close security holes.

54
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.660
And if something practical and reliable was created digitally,

55
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.100
not only can you reuse the blueprint all over your country,

56
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.960
but the actual thing itself can be deployed anywhere,

57
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
even internationally!

58
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.580
A great example of this is "FixMyStreet":

59
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.460
Originally developed in Great Britain

60
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.420
as a Free Software app to report,

61
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.420
view and discuss local problems

62
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940
like potholes,

63
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.080
it's now being used all over the world.

64
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.700
Everyone benefits

65
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.960
because new features and improvements

66
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960
are shared by everyone.

67
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.480
If all our software were developed like this,

68
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.220
we could stop struggling with restrictive licenses

69
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.860
and could start thinking about where and how

70
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860
software could help us.

71
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.040
We could concentrate

72
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.920
on creating a better society for everyone.

73
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.200
So, if you think that tomorrow's infrastructure

74
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.460
should be in our own hands,

75
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.680
help us now by sharing this video

76
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.460
and visiting our website:

77
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.460
www.publiccode.eu

78
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.460
It's time to make our demand:

79
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.180
Public money?

80
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.940
Public code!
